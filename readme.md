# PowerPoint Gesture Control

A Python-based gesture control system for PowerPoint presentations using hand gestures and webcam input. This application allows you to control your PowerPoint presentations using natural hand gestures, making your presentations more interactive and engaging.

## Features

- **Natural Hand Gestures**: Control your presentation using intuitive hand movements
- **Laser Pointer Mode**: Point to specific areas on your slides
- **Smooth Gesture Detection**: Advanced gesture recognition with smoothing to prevent accidental triggers
- **Real-time Feedback**: Visual feedback of detected gestures
- **Cross-platform Support**: Works on macOS, Windows, and Linux

## Gestures

1. **Fist Gesture** (üëä)
   - Toggles the laser pointer mode
   - Uses Command+L keyboard shortcut

2. **Pinch Gesture** (ü§è)
   - Toggles fullscreen mode
   - Uses Command+Enter keyboard shortcut

3. **Swipe Left** (üëà)
   - Goes to the previous slide
   - Uses Left Arrow key

4. **Swipe Right** (üëâ)
   - Goes to the next slide
   - Uses Right Arrow key

5. **Point Gesture** (üëÜ)
   - Activates laser pointer mode
   - Move your index finger to point at specific areas

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- OpenCV (cv2)
- MediaPipe
- NumPy
- PyAutoGUI

## Usage

1. Make sure your webcam is connected and working
2. Open your PowerPoint presentation
3. Run the gesture control system:
```bash
python gesture_control.py
```
4. Position yourself in front of the webcam
5. Use the gestures to control your presentation

## Tips for Best Performance

- Ensure good lighting conditions
- Keep your hand within the webcam's view
- Make clear, distinct gestures
- For fist gesture, curl all fingers into your palm
- For swipe gestures, move your hand horizontally with fingers extended
- For pinch gesture, bring thumb and index finger close together

## Troubleshooting

- If gestures aren't being detected:
  - Check webcam permissions
  - Ensure proper lighting
  - Adjust your distance from the webcam
  - Make more distinct gestures

- If laser pointer isn't working:
  - Ensure PowerPoint is in focus
  - Check if Command+L shortcut is enabled in PowerPoint
  - Try toggling the laser pointer mode again
